# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Polished an electron app - Calculator. Started building a native Google assistant using GTK+Python

**Thoughts** Native Gtk app development is a new frontier for me. Hoping to develop a decent polished Google assistant desktop client.

### Day 2: December 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple arduino webhook setup, where a press of a button triggers an IFTTT webhook
 
**Thoughts** Arduino development is easy, though the python-serial communication was a learning today(simple though). Also interfacing with LCD was fun.

### Day 3: December 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple interface for getting the orientation of the Accelerometer (ADXL335) in Text through Processing.
 
**Thoughts** Interfacing Arduino and Processing is easy and fun. Working with the drawing APIS of Processing was a learning today.
