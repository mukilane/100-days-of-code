# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Polished an electron app - Calculator. Started building a native Google assistant using GTK+Python

**Thoughts** Native Gtk app development is a new frontier for me. Hoping to develop a decent polished Google assistant desktop client.
